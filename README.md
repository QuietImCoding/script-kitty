## Get your scripts together

## The Problem ##

We've all been there. You configure this one thing, and tweak this other thing and seemlingly out of nowhere you find your bash environment is basically entire custom operating system! Of course, this happens incrementally, so that as long as you are working on your own machine, you are in a perpetual state of workflow bliss, masterfully navigating between obscure menus and running strange scripts on random dotfiles. 

But what happens when you need to log into another computer? Panic. Pandemonium. "Oh no my custom aliases do nothing!" you exclaim, wincing at the thought of having to type out all 7 command line flags for that one AWS command. 

## The Kitty ##

Script kitty is meant to be systematic solution to all of your terminal environment woes. Still in early development, script kitty imposes a common-sense framework on your dumpster fire of a bash config and makes it so that if you ever need to move computers, you can just use your kitty config file to install your custom scripts and manage their configurations. Gone are the days of going repo by repo, trying to figure out where that one alias is on Github. Script kitty is here to help.

#### Disclaimer ####

Script kitty is in *very* early development, and is something of a side project. Feel free to contribute and give feedback but don't go into this thinking everything will work purrfectly.
